# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Data Modeling 2nd project 

## Introduction 
This project aims to create an Apache Cassandra database and ETL pipeline using Python for the Sparkify streaming app, where songs and user activity are collected, with interest in understanding which songs users listen to the most in the app.  

## DataSets   
Sparkify collected their app data in one directory called event_data:

- event_data Dataset: 
    - is a directory of CSV files that are partitioned by date
   

## Apache Cassandra database Modeling and ETL Pipeline Steps: 
The folowing steps are found in "Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb", 
1- Design the tables based on the queries that we need an answer for.
2- CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements for Apache Cassandra Database
3- CREATE the statements for the tables the we have designed if they are not already exist  
4- INSERT the data into its relevant tables 
5- Test the select statements with the correct WHERE clause
